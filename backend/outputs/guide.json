      "name": "Basic Stance and Posture",
      "how": "Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes pointed forward. Keep your knees bent and back straight, with your weight distributed evenly on both legs.",

      "name": "Arm Position and Relaxation",
      "how": "Hold your arms up, elbows bent and relaxed, with your fists near your chest. Keep your shoulders down and relaxed, and your elbows close to your body.",
      "why": "This position allows for a quick, snapping motion and utilizes the full range of motion in your arms.",

      "name": "Weight Shift and Rotation",
      "how": "Shift your weight onto your back leg, then quickly shift it forward onto your front leg while rotating your hips and torso. This weight transfer and rotation adds power to the punch.",

      "name": "Combine the Elements",
