      "cue": "Imagine your fist is whipping through the air, leaving a trail of fire behind it.\nKeep your eyes on your target and maintain a tight, compact guard throughout the motion.",
      "pose_hints": "Start from your dominant side (e.g., right-handed = orthodox stance). Position your feet shoulder-width apart, with your dominant foot back, knees bent.\nKeeping your non-punching hand up by your cheek, rotate your body slightly to the right, loading your weight onto your back foot.\nExplosively rotate your body back to the left, driving through your rear foot and straightening your knee.\nSimultaneously, throw a compact uppercut by rotating your arm clockwise (when viewed from above), bending your elbow, and snapping your fist upwards in a tight, vertical arc.\nFocus on whipping your fist through the target, keeping your elbow close to your body.",
      "rationale": "This step teaches the fundamental movement pattern of the uppercut, emphasizing the importance of body rotation for power generation.",

      "cue": "Use your jab to create an opening and distract your opponent before throwing the uppercut.\nImagine your uppercut is slicing through your opponent's guard, finding a narrow gap to land cleanly.",
      "pose_hints": "From your boxing stance, take a small step forward with your front foot, closing the distance to your imaginary opponent.\nThrow a quick jab with your lead hand, followed immediately by a powerful rear uppercut, rotating your body and driving off your back foot.\nFocus on keeping your feet balanced and your weight distributed evenly to avoid overextending.\nPractice targeting different areas, such as the chin, solar plexus, or ribs, adjusting your angle and footwork accordingly.",
      "rationale": "This step teaches you how to set up an uppercut effectively and incorporate it into your combination punching. Proper footwork ensures balance and stability, allowing you to deliver powerful uppercuts without compromising your defense.",

      "pose_hints": "Practice throwing uppercuts while backpedaling or slipping punches (imagined or with a partner).\nWhen slipping, use head movement to evade imaginary punches, then counter with a quick uppercut, focusing on speed and accuracy.\nWhile backpedaling, maintain your guard and throw uppercuts as you create distance, keeping your balance and a compact stance.",
