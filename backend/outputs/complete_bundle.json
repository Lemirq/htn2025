      "The power of an uppercut comes from rotational force, not just arm strength",
      "Proper footwork and body rotation are crucial for generating power and maintaining balance",

Position your feet shoulder-width apart, with your dominant foot back, knees bent.\nKeeping your non-punching hand up by your cheek, rotate your body slightly to the right, loading your weight onto your back foot.\nExplosively rotate your body back to the left, driving through your rear foot and straightening your knee.\nSimultaneously, throw a compact uppercut by rotating your arm clockwise (when viewed from above), bending your elbow, and snapping your fist upwards in a tight, vertical arc.\nFocus on whipping your fist through the target, keeping your elbow close to your body.",
